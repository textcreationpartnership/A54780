            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe holy Apoſtle of our Lord, S. <hi>Peter,</hi> conſidering the danger, which even the faithful and children of God live in, whileſt they remain in this mortall life, through the craft and policy of the enemy of mankind, ſaith unto them, <hi>Brethren be ſober and watch, becauſe our adverſary the divell, as a roaring Lion, goeth about, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. not with his teeth or jawes, but by a crafty and ſubtill kind of ſuggeſtion of impious thoughts unto the minds of men, by which (conſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) as the Scriptures affirm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.18. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. he not only defileth their hearts, expelleth God out of their bodies, and ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe to dwell there, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.45. but alſo raigneth and domineereth over them ſo rigorouſly, that they muſt not conſtantly think but what he will. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19.</p>
            <p>And knowing by the excellency of his wit, and long experience, that if he ſhould ſuffer ſacred pictures, ſignes, memories and images (the inſtruments of pious thoughts) every where publikely to ſtand, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected as they ought; there would be no quiet reſting, or abode for him in their hearts, without ſeeking for himſelf a new lodging in other parts; becauſe there is no agreement betweene Chriſt and Belial, therefore ſo by certain ſlights and cunning
<pb facs="tcp:42187:3"/>ſuggeſtions, ſtirreth up men of light belief, and unconſtant minds, in whoſe heart, (as our Saviour ſaith) he liveth, to diſgrace and beat them down as idolls, after this manner.</p>
            <p>Whereas all words have divers ſenſes, and all things divers formalities, concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reſpects, he never permitteth them over whom he hath power, or in whoſe heart he dwelleth, to take the words of ſacred ſigns, pictures and images in the ſame ſenſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, conception, or reſpect, in which they were delivered unto the Church of God, by our Saviour and the Apoſtles, or in which Roman Catholiques take them at this day, that is to ſay, as relatives, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are nothing, but a connotation of the things which they repreſent, the divell mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly will alwayes have them, in whom he dwelleth, to take them for things abſolute, and ſo deceiveth them, to the baniſhing of pious thoughts out of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>As for example, we may conſider the things which we commonly call an image, either to be a carved or an ingraven ſtock or ſtone, or a painted cloth or paper; or els we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, as it is an image of ſome common thing, or els of ſome heavenly or divine, or of the myſteries of our faith, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reflection upon it; or els we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, not only as it is the image of ſome heavenly and divine thing, or of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our faith, but alſo as it doth repreſent
<pb facs="tcp:42187:4"/>unto us the ſaid heavenly and divine things, or the myſteries of our faith, and doth, or may beget in our hearts pious thoughts; as the image or reſemblance of Chriſt upon the croſs, as it doth repreſent his ſufferings for us; or his image, as he is in heaven, as it doth repreſent him unto us in that glory; and ſo doth or may beget in us pious thoughts of his mercy and ſuffering for us, or els of the glory of the other life, in which laſt ſenſe the Church of God, and Roman Catholikes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes take ſacred pictures, ſigns and images, when they give unto them any religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, honor, or reverence.</p>
            <p>And Satan, to deceive thoſe in whom he dwelleth, as in his houſe and home, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his poſſeſſion, alwayes maliciouſly and wittingly ſuggeſteth unto them, that the church of God, and Roman Catholikes take images in the firſt or ſecond ſenſe, that is to ſay, either as they are carved or ingraven ſtocks and ſtones, of painted cloaths, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or an image in common, without any further repreſentation, and then ſtirreth them up by his ſuggeſtions, not only to beat them down as idols, but alſo to accuſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholikes of idolatry, as though they adored ſtocks, and ſtones, or painted papers, or cloaths, not only to the extirpation of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts out of the hearts of men, but alſo to the great diſturbance of the peace and unity which ſhould be amongſt Chriſtians,

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> What our thoughts be in generall, and how they are viſions, or words, or ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of our hearts.</head>
               <p>BEfore we enter into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, how to <hi>nouriſh pious thoughts,</hi> it is neceſſary firſt to ſpeak of thoughts in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, what they be, and how they have place in our ſouls: Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of pious thoughts, and how to attain unto them: and laſt of all, how to cheriſh and nouriſh them, that we may abound with piety, which is a vertue of ſo great eminency, and excellency, that as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is profitable to all things.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. and withall, as there he ſaith, <hi>hath the promiſe of this life that now is, and of that to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42187:8"/>come;</hi> and what more can be deſired of men in this vale of tears?</p>
               <p>Now for the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what our thoughts are, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary firſt to obſerve, that many things in the outward ſenſes are two, which in the inward ſoul are but one: as for example, to ſee, and to hear, in the outward ſenſes are two reall diſtinct things, which in the inward ſoul are both one. The ſoule having reall diſtinct powers, but not parts, from whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſſe, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the nineth and tenth chapters of his fifteenth book of the Trinity excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently noteth, that to heare and to ſee, as alſo to ſpeak and to ſee, in the inward ſoul are both one. Whereupon he deſcribeth a thought, ſaying:
<hi>A thought is a certain viſion of the ſoul, whether theſe things be preſent, which are ſeen with the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleys, or perceived by the other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; or they be abſent, and their like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42187:8"/>only is ſeen by thought; or if neither of theſe, but theſe things are thought upon, which are neither corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, nor yet have corporall ſhapes, as vertues and vices, or as the thought it ſelf, when it is thought upon.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of our thoughts.</p>
               <p>Again in the ſame place he ſaith alſo, <hi>That thoughts are ſpeeches, or words of the heart,</hi> which he proveth by the Scriptures, which ſay, <hi>They ſaid, thinking within themſelves, Wiſ.</hi> 2.1. Again, <hi>certain of the Scribes ſaid within themſelves. Mat.</hi> 9.3. Again, <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees began to think, ſaying, Luk.</hi>
5.21. where the thoughts of men are called the words, or ſayings of the heart; ſo that a thought is rightly deſcribed, according to S.
<hi>Auguſtina, to be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, word, or ſpeech of the heart,</hi> which if we could bring to be pious in all men, and to be ſtrengthened and nouriſhed, we ſhould eaſily make piety to abound in the world;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42187:9"/>for as S. <hi>Aug.</hi> there ſaith; <hi>When we ſay, that thoughts are words of the heart, we do not therefore deny them to be viſions, ſprung from the viſion of things ſignified unto us, becauſe in the inward ſoul they are both one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it could be brought to paſſe, that men in their inward ſouls ſhould neither heare, nor ſee, nor ſpeak, or that which is all one, not think of any thing, but with dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, which were not pious, they muſt needs abound with piety, and be very happy; becauſe, as S.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>they ſhould be profitable to all things;</hi> and alſo be partakers of the promiſes which God hath made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſervants in this life, and in that which is to come; here to be happy by grace, and in the other by glory, which I heartily wiſh unto thee Reader.</p>

               <p>NOt every thought of a good thing is therefore preſently a pious thought. The divell ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thinketh upon God, though he cannot have a pious thought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is confirmed in malice; and evill men think many times upon good things, but with an evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Wherefore as S.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his twelfth Sermon upon the 118. Pſalm ſaith,
<hi>We ſhould not only think that it is good which we do, but alſo, and that chiefly, if it he good, for which we do it:</hi> Wherefore for a thought to be pious, it is not onely ſufficient that we think of a good thing, but alſo that we think upon it to a good end; &amp; God being the laſt end of man, then our thoughts are truly pious; when we think
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42187:10"/>on holy and ſacred things, or the works of mercy, or the obligations of our eſtate, &amp;c with an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind to adhere unto them, as unto things which may either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, or mediately conduct us to God, the end of all our h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pes: So that in few words, an abſolute pious thought is an inward viſion, ſpeech, or motion of the mind, by which we either immediately, or mediately adhere unto God, the laſt end our happineſſe.</p>
               <p>From hence it is that the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> a pious man, and a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods own heart, ſaith, <hi>I have inclined my heart to do thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifications for ever for reward, Pſal.</hi> 118.112. Again in the ſame Pſalm, <hi>I have not declined from thy Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> Thus the Prophet; to inſtruct us, that the only thinking upon a holy or ſacred thing, is not ſufficient to beget an abſolute pious thought; but the thinking upon it, with an
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42187:10"/>inclination of mind to adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, for the benefit we receive by it, and for Gods ſake, the end of our happineſſe.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, an abſolute wicked thought is a full or delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conſent of the mind, or thought, to do any thing againſt the Commandements of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men become curſed and wicked, as witneſſeth the Prophet in the ſame Pſalm, ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt very much commanded thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be kept, curſed are they that decline from thy Commandements,</hi> though it be but with full conſent of thought, as he further witneſſeth in the ſaid Pſalm, ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt deſpiſed all that revolt from thy judgements, becauſe their thought is unjuſt, or wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to think upon an evill thing, or to have a ſuggeſtion of evill put into our minds, either by the fleſh, world, or divell, who are our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42187:11"/>without any inclination of will, or conſent of heart to do it, is not properly called an evil thought, but a ſuggeſtion, carnall motion, or temptation. So likewiſe to think only upon a good or holy thing, without any inclination of heart, or mind unto it, is not properly a pious thought; but when we have an extenſion of heart to adhere unto it, as unto a thing which may either immediately, or mediately conduct us unto God, the laſt end of all our happineſſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> How all evills proceed from evill thoughts:</head>
               <p>IF we would ſeriouſly conſider from whence all the evills, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and miſchiefs, which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in heaven or earth, are origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſprung, or have had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or yet do daily ariſe; we ſhall eaſily find, that they originally
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42187:11"/>have proceeded, and even at this day do proceed from impious and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoughts.</p>
               <p>In heaven all the Angells and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall Spirits lived in peace, and unity with God, and amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, untill <hi>Lucifer</hi> one of the chiefeſt amongſt the Intelligencers or Angells, begun to think wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to ſay in his heart, <hi>I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into heaven, above the starres of God I will exalt my throne, Eſay.</hi> 14.13. And upon earth there was no evill, ſickneſſe, or infirmities, or miſeries amongſt men, untill man began to think impiouſly, that he would be <hi>like God, Gen.</hi> 3.5. Whereupon truth it ſelf ſaith, <hi>Out of the heart come forth evill thoughts, murders, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, fornications, theft, falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, blaſphemies, theſe are the things which defile the ſoul, Mat.</hi> 15.19. which is alſo confirmed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, for in all our voluntary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, we firſt think before we do;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42187:12"/>whereby it is ſufficiently manifeſt unto any reaſonable man, that all the miſeries and calamities which heretofore have been, or now are in the world, or hereafter ſhall be, originally proceed from evill thoughts; wherefore if we could but plant the Nurſe of pious thoughts amongſt men, we ſhould in great part, at leaſt, eaſe them of their miſeries, contentions, civill warres, Sects, and brawls.</p>
               <p>Neither would the planting of pious thoughts amongſt mankind be a thing of ſo great a difficulty to bring to paſſe, if they would but firmly and conſtantly believe the truth in this matter; which is, that evill thoughts do not only ſeparate, and divide one man from another, and bring in all thoſe calamities and miſeries, which we daily ſee amongſt men, but alſo divide man from God, make diviſions even in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and deprive him of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42187:12"/>weal, as witneſſe the Scriptures, ſaying, <hi>Perverſe thoughts ſeparate from God, Wiſd.</hi> 1.3.

               <p>Now what man is there, who is indued with reaſon, and will be ſenſible of his own good or evill, that (the aforeſaid miſeries conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) will not hate all impious thoughts, and be glad of the means how to nouriſh in himſelfe pious thoughts, eſpecially the Scripture ſaying,

               <p>For the aforeſaid reaſons, our dear Lord and Saviour being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the good and ſalvation of mankind, reprehendeth man for his evill thoughts, ſaying; <hi>Wherefore think ye evill in your hearts, Mat.</hi> 9.4. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> knowing the many miſeries and wretchedneſſe which attend upon impious thoughts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth all men to practiſe, and nouriſh in themſelves pious thoughts, ſaying;

<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon this Text ſaith, <hi>You may ſee how S.</hi> Paul <hi>would caſt all wicked thoughts out of our minds, for from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill thoughts all wicked deeds proceed.</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42187:14"/>From hence it is that the Prophet calleth thoſe happy, who preſently correct, or kill their evill thoughts, which he calleth <hi>Daughters of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> ſaying, daughter of Babylon, (<hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall hold, and ſhall cruſh thy little ones againſt the rock, Pſal.</hi> 136.9. <hi>who are theſe little ones of Babylon,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon this Text, <hi>but our ariſing evill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, when it is a little one or as ſoon as it ariſeth, cruſh it.

               <p>God will not only examine our outward works and words, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our very thoughts and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our hearts; whereupon the Prophet
<hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Waſh thy heart from malice O Hieruſalem, that thou mayeſt be ſaved; how long ſhall hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cogitations abide in thee?

               <p>Amongſt the Sacrifices which

               <p>And ſhewing the reaſon why he was ſo a verſed from the things which formerly he had expreſly commanded, addeth, becauſe they were not performed with ſuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts, and purity of heart, as he deſired, ſaying, <hi>Your aſſemblies are wicked, your hands are full of bloud, waſh you, be clean, take away the evill of your cogitations from mine eye, &amp;c. and come and accuſe me, ſaith our Lord, if your ſins ſhall be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be made white as ſnow; and if they be red as vermilion, they ſhall be white as wooll, Iſa.</hi> 13.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42187:18"/>and will make thee a houſe when thy daies ſhall be accompliſhed, and thou ſhalt ſleep with thy fathers; I will raiſe up thy ſeed after thee, which ſhall come forth of thy womb, and J will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabliſh his Kingdome; He ſhall build a houſe to my name, and I will esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the throne of his Kingdome for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi>

               <p>Our Saviour ſitting over againſt the Treaſury of the Temple, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how the multitude did caſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the Treaſury, and many rich men gave liberally; but when there came a poor widow, ſhe caſt in two mites, which is a farthing; he calling his Diſciples together, ſaid, <hi>Amen J ſay to you, that this poor wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow hath cast in more then all the reſt, for all theſe of their abundance have caſt into the gifts of God but ſhe of her penury hath caſt in all her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that ſhe had, Mark</hi> 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. So though her gift in ſubſtance was the leaſt, yet the piety of her mind,

                  <hi>It is not poſſible</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the place before cited) <hi>that he can have evill deeds or works, who hath good thoughts, for the deeds or works proceed from the thoughts: neither can any man do any thing, or move any of his members to do any act, unleſſe firſt

               <p>The ſenſes bring in the outward viſible ſpecies, images, ſigns, figures, or forms of things, and place them in the phantaſie and memory; the memory and phantaſie propounds them to the will and underſtanding, and the underſtanding and will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing them, frame thoughts and actions accordingly: for as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> in the eighth chapter of his t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For this cauſe S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored and worſhipped the latchet of our Saviours ſhoes with a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive religious worſhip, which end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Saviour, ſaying, <hi>whoſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet of his ſhoe I am not worthy to unlooſe, John</hi> 1.1.2.7. And he who ſo much honored the latchet of his ſhoe, as that he thought himſelf not worthy to touch it, in reſpect of the ſupereminent honor which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to our Saviour; imagine if you can the innumerable pious thoughts of God, and of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our faith which were in his ſoul, ſeeing that God

               <p>THe thoughts for the moſt part following the ſenſes, (as I have ſhewed in the precedent chapter) to have pious and golden thoughts, it is not only neceſſary to avoid vaine and idle ſpecies and formes, but alſo to have often, or for the moſt part, before our eyes ſacred artificiall pictures, ſignes, and images, thereby to imprint in our hearts ſacred and pious thoughts: but we call theſe ſacred artificiall pictures, ſignes and images, which repreſent unto us holy, and divine, and inviſible things, or the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our faith, &amp;c. and as they do repreſent them unto us, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in our hearts the knowledge of the aforeſaid divine things or

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42187:28"/>in the aforeſaid chapter ſaith, <hi>faith is by hearing, and hearing is by the word of God;</hi> and words are but ſignes of things, as witneſſeth <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> in the firſt chapter of his firſt book of <hi>Perihermanias,</hi> and <hi>Pierius</hi> in his book of the ſacred Egyptian letters throughout; neither as I have proved in the precedent chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, do the things themſelves enter into the mind by the ſenſes, but their ſignes, pictures, formes or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, whereby it appeareth that the neceſſity of uſing ſacred artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſignes, pictures, and images is ſuch, as that without them we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learn divine things, or the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our faith.</p>

               <p>AS our Oppoſers would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what we mean by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred pictures, figures and images, no more will they underſtand what we intend by a Relative Religious Worſhip, unleſſe we explicate it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; wherefore here it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to repeat what I have ſaid in the firſt and ſecond chapters of our book, of the honor and prayer to Saints, where I have ſhewed, that as there are in generall two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes upon earch, th'one tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42187:31"/>th'other ſpirituall, ſo alſo in generall (and for as much as will ſerve for our purpoſe) there are two kinds of honors and worſhips, the one civill, belonging to the temporall Kingdome, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, belonging to the ſpirituall Kingdome, and both theſe kinds of honors and worſhips have divers degrees, diviſions, or diſtributions, according to the divers and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dignities in the ſaid King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and yet keep one or the ſame name of honor or worſhip, with little variety in words, more then the termes of religious, civill or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious.</p>
               <p>As for example, all the honor and worſhip which is in the temporall Kingdome, as it is temporall, and not Chriſtan, whether it be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, or Gods, or Kings, or his Officers, or other of his Subjects, is but civill or ſuperſtitious, though it be divided into divers acts, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42187:32"/>and degrees, for theſe who have no true Religion (as Turks, Jews, and Infidells,) can have no true religious worſhip amongſt them; therefore all the honor and worſhip which can or may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, is but civill or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, according to the humane vertues, dignities, or ſuperſtition, which is uſed amongſt them, though it be divided into divers degrees; and that civill or ſuperſtitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip whith they beſtow upon God, or Gods, or their Kings, may not be given to every temporall man or Officer amongſt them, but an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, according to the civill or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious dignity, or office, or eſteem of every one, or the relation any thing amongſt them hath to a higher civill or ſuperſtitious power; the ſame we ſay of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the ſpirituall Kingdome of Gods Church, as it is ſpirituall, that whether it be exhibited to God, or

               <p>This noble morall vertue of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as alſo other morall vertues, hath divers acts or operations, ſome whereof only reſpect God, as he is God and Creator of all things, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his Angels and Saints, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall perſons, or eccleſiaſticall and ſacred things dedicated to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and ſervice; as it reſpecteth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and chiefly God, it is divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and worſhip, or an abſolute worſhip, independent upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, as it reſpecteth the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ſacred things dedicated to his ſervice, it is relative religious ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and worſhip, becauſe it is not abſolute, or ſtayeth there, but hath a further relation to God, the end of all goodneſſe, as of whom, and by whom, and from whom the thing worſhipped hath that honor and

               <p>The like we find in other morall vertues; as for example, in Juſtice, though the ſubſtance and nature of this vertue be one particular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, yet her operations and effects are divers and different, whereof ſome are occupied about God, as he is God and Creator of all things, others about his creatures; and that work or operation which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Juſtice we beſtow upon God, as he is God and Creator of all things (as love of the whole heart) may not be beſtowed upon his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but an other of an inferiour and relative quality; and the like we may ſay of other morall vertues, and alſo of Religion, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his 2<hi>a.</hi> 2<hi>ae, quaeſt.</hi> 81. to be one ſpeciall moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble morall vertue, diſtinct onely by reaſon from holineſſe, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her proper acts and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

12.16. where the Scriptures call the reverence and reſpect which was borne unto the Ceremonies and ſignes which repreſented our Lords paſſage over the houſes of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael in Egypt, a Religion, where they uſed a relative religious worſhip, as of the ſame nature, and not a civill, which is of another kind.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Aaron and his children
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42187:35"/>ſhall be Prieſts to me by a perpetuall Religion, Exod.</hi> 29.9. Again, <hi>This is the annoynting of Aaron and his ſons in the Ceremonies of our Lord, &amp;c. by a perpetuall Religion in their generations, Exod.</hi> 7.35. where the Scriptures call the ſignes and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which were uſed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his children to be Prieſts, a Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be performed with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward relative religious reſpect and reverence.

               <p>The Scriptures alſo ſpeaking of an addition of many people unto
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42187:36"/>the Rites and Ceremonies of the Jewes, ſay,
<hi>Many other Nations and Sects were joyned to their Religion and Ceremonies, Heſter</hi> 8.17. whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>According to the moſt pure Sect of our Religion, I was a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, Act.</hi> 26.6. where the Scriptures and S. <hi>Paul</hi> call the whole practiſe which they had about ſacred things or things dedicated to the honor of God, and uſe of their divine ſervice, a <hi>Religion,</hi> and then the reſpect and reverence which they were to uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſaid things, muſt be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as of the ſame nature, for as our Saviour ſaid, <hi>We doe not gather grapes on thornes, or figs on thistles, Mat.</hi> 7.16.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man think himſelf to be religious, not bridling his tongue, this mans religion is vaine, Iames</hi>

               <p>Civill honor, worſhip and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be given unto prophane men, as witneſſeth the fact of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who ſeeing

The Roman ſouldiers of all Nations, as well faithfull as Infidells, adored the Imperiall Enſign called <hi>Labarum,</hi> as witneſſeth <hi>Zozomenus</hi> in the fourth chapter of his firſt book of hiſtories; and all people and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who are not exceeding barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, have worſhipped and honored the Chair of Eſtate, Scepter, Crown,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42187:37"/>and the very name of their Kings and Emperors, when it hath been pronounced in publike Edicts: whereby it appeareth, that a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip more then civill is due unto the friends of God, and ſacred things dedicated to his honor and ſervice, otherwiſe you put no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene ſacred things and prophane, which God condemneth, ſaying, <hi>Her Prieſts have contemned my law, and have polluted my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, between a holy thing and a prophane they have put no difference, Ezech.</hi> 22.26. whereupon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>when he had made as it were a whip of little cords, he cast them who ſold oxen, and ſheep, and doves, and bankers out of the Temple, Joh.</hi> 2.13. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> reprehended divers Chriſtians for eating in the Church, ſaying, <hi>Have you not houſes to eat and drink in, or contemn you the Church of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22.</p>
               <p>The Officers of Chriſt in his

<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and Legats by relation do partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in ſome part of the honor and worſhip which is due unto their Lords and Maſters; wherefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to God is due an abſolute religious worſhip, to the Officers of Gods Church, or his Legats, muſt be due an inward and outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative religious worſhip; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The fathers of our fleſh we had for inſtructors, and we did reverence them,</hi> not with civill honor only, but with ſome kind of religious, as inſtructors of Religion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour ſaith of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>You are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, Ioh.</hi> 15.19. Again, <hi>of the world they are not, as I alſo am not of the world, Ioh.</hi> 17.17. and therefore there did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them an honour and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42187:38"/>worſhip, not worldly, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</p>
               <p>Father and Son are relatives, and the Son by all right (though in an inferiour degree) is partaker of his Fathers honor and worſhip, our Adverſaries confeſſe that religious honor belongeth unto God, and the Scriptures confeſſe that pious and devout Chriſtians are the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſons of God, ſaying, <hi>We are the ſons of God, and if ſons, heires alſo, heirs truly of God, and coheirs of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.17. whereby it may juſtly be doubted, that thoſe who deny an inward and outward rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive religious worſhip unto the Saints and eminent ſervants of God, have neither part nor portion in the inheritance of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The things which are dedicated to the ſervice of God, are called <hi>ſacred</hi> by God himſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.10. therefore there is due unto them an inward and outward ſacred
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42187:39"/>relative worſhip, which is the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive religious worſhip we ſpeak of; whereupon all the <hi>Lexicons</hi> and
<hi>Dictionaries,</hi> not onely of Romane Catholiques, but alſo of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries themſelves, (as of <hi>Thomas Thomaſius</hi>) do interpret this word, <hi>Religio; a true worſhip of God or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things,</hi> and all Nations cannot be deceived.</p>
               <p>Moreover, our Adverſaries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that there are religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, or things which belong unto Religion, as the Scriptures, Preaching, Teaching, Prayer, the Sacraments; unto which if our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries will grant no kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip, they deſtroy all Religion, and prove themſelves to be <hi>prophane as Eſau, Heb.</hi> 12.16.</p>
               <p>Religion and holineſſe do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally differ, as S.
<hi>Thomas</hi> (2.2<hi>ae. quaeſt.</hi> 81. <hi>Art.</hi> 8.) proveth; therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can their operations or effects really differ, but holineſſe is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42187:39"/>about creatures, as witneſſeth the Scripture, ſaying, <hi>follow peace with all men, and holineſſe, Heb</hi>
12.14. Againe, <hi>holineſſe becometh thy houſe O Lord, Pſal.</hi>
92.5. not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute holineſſe, for ſo God only is holy; but a relative, as conducting us by meanes unto God, who is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy of himſelfe; ſo likewiſe the chiefeſt part of the Tabernacle was called <hi>The Sanctuary of Sanctuaries,</hi> and <hi>Holy of Holies, Exod.</hi> 26. God alſo commanded <hi>Moyſes</hi> to make <hi>holy vestments for</hi> Aaron
<hi>and his ſons,</hi> wherein they might miniſter unto him, or ſerve him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. But to ſerve God belongeth to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, therefore theſe were religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous veſtments, and had both an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward relative religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reverence and reſpect born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſeeing that none might wear them but <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, and then only when they attended unto the ſervice of God. The like
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42187:40"/>we may ſay of all the things which belonged unto the Temple, and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of the Altar, of holy ground, holy Mountain, holy Scriptures, &amp;c. which are holy by a holineſſe that referreth us to God, and alſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and to be reverenced with a relative religious worſhip, for the ſame cauſe holy and religious being really both one.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, at all times, and in all ages the faithful honored and worſhipped ſacred things, whether they were immediately or mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dedicated to the ſervice of God, which are inward and outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative religious worſhip, as I ſhall further ſhew in the enſuing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

               <p>God created all things in heaven and upon earth for man, and man for himſelf, ſo that man may not uſe any of the creatures of God or himſelf for himſelfe, or to himſelfe onely, or do any thing to himſelfe, or for himſelf only without offence to God, much leſſe may he make pictures, ſigns and images to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only, or to bow down to them or worſhip them, or ſerve them for himſelf only.</p>
               <p>This is ſelf-love, or <hi>Philantia,</hi> not onely forbidden by the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and condemned by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying,

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42187:46"/>it according to the paterne that was ſhewed thee in the Mount, Exod.</hi> 25.40. whereupon S. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid unto the Jewes, <hi>The Tabernacle of Testimony was among our fathers in the deſert, as God ordained, ſpeaking to</hi> Moyſes, <hi>that he ſhould make it according to the form which he had ſeen, Acts</hi> 7.44. which S.
<hi>Paul</hi> alſo confirmeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. wherefore it cannot be denied, but that it is lawfull to make holy artificiall pictures, ſigns and images, and to place them in Churches, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by the Commandement of God ſuch things have beene made for the Tabernacle and Temple of the people of Iſrael, which were ſigns and figures of the Chriſtian Church, as witneſſeth S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Again God ſaid to <hi>Moyſes, The children of</hi> Iſrael
<hi>ſhall make to me a Sanctuary, and I will dwell in the midſt of them, according to all the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the Tabernacle which I

6.</p>
               <p>Moreover the two Tables of the Commandements which God gave to
<hi>Moyſes</hi> in the Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> were ſacred artificiall graven things, ſigns or pictures, as witneſſe the Scriptures, ſaying,
<hi>Moyſes returned from the Mount, carrying the two Tables of Teſtimony in his hand, written on both ſides, and made by the work of God, the writing alſo of God was graven in the Tables, Exod.</hi> 32.15. And words are but ſignes, figures, or images of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42187:47"/>things, as witneſſeth
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the firſt chapter of his firſt book,
<hi>Peri-Hermenias,</hi> and <hi>Pierius</hi> in his books of the ſacred Egyptian let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Moreover the nature of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it cannot be, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a picture, ſign or image on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as they are the ſimilitudes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things) or the placing of them within Churches or Temples ſhould be forbidden, for ſo God ſhould be contrary to himſelf, who hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man after ſuch a manner, that he cannot naturally learn, know, or underſtand any thing, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſame, under ſome corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall image or likeneſſe, his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſo depending upon his ſenſes, that he cannot know any thing, which either by it ſelf, or in ſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, is not firſt repreſented by ſome ſenſe; as for example, we ſee viſible creatures, and hear ſounds or voyces, whereby the common ſenſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42187:47"/>being informed with ſuch an image, as it is able to conceive, offereth the ſame to our phantaſie or imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereupon the mind beginneth to gather knowledge, and to print (as it were) or to ingrave in it ſelfe that which is repreſented unto it by the ſenſes, and therefore maketh judgement, and gathereth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge out of theſe images, ſpecies, or repreſentations, in ſuch ſort, that as often as the mind will either uſe knowledge, or ſeek to increaſe in it, ſhe alwayes returneth to theſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, figures or ſpecies which ſhe hath received, and laid up in the gulph of her memory, to the end, that ſhe may have wherewithall to occupy her ſelf, and take delight, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requireth: And thus God of his goodneſſe hath created man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth that he neither hath prohibited men from making ſacred pictures, ſigns or images, nor from the placing them in Churches, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42187:48"/>that both Almighty. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them to be made, and to be placed in his Temple, and that man cannot learn divine things, but by ſacred artificiall pictures, ſignes and images.</p>
               <p>As there are prophane and vaine images, pictures, ſimilitudes, and ſigns, ſo there are ſacred and holy, as witneſſeth God himſelf, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Tabernacle and the artificiall images, and graven things which did belong unto it, <hi>ſacred things, Exod.</hi> 31.10. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten words of the Bible, which are but ſigns, pictures and images (as I have proved heretofore) <hi>holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
3.25. and the places moſt fit for holy things, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly or indirectly repreſent unto us God, and heavenly things, are Churches, Chappells, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which alſo themſelves are, or ought to be ſignes, images and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of heaven; ſo that the places
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42187:48"/>of ſacred pictures in holy Churches, Chappels or Temples, is but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of a <hi>decorum,</hi> in placing like with like, not to caſt pearles before ſwine, nor do injury to holy things, by putting them in prophane places.</p>
               <p>Temples, Churches, and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels ought to repreſent unto us hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as witneſſeth the Scriptures, ſaying of the place where
<hi>Iacob</hi> worſhipped God, <hi>This is none other but the houſe of God, Gen.</hi> 28.17. in whoſe houſe be Angels and Saints, whoſe Similitudes, Temples, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Chappels are to repreſent; whereupon the Temple in the Old Law, which was a figure of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, and Chappels, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with pictures and images, as witneſſeth the Scriptures, ſaying,
<hi>Solomon made in the Oracle</hi> (which was in the moſt inward part of the Temple) <hi>two Cherubins of olive trees of ten cubits in height, &amp;c. and all the walls of the Temple round about he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42187:49"/>graved with divers ingravings and carving, and he made in them Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, and palm trees, and divers pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, as it were standing out of the wall, and coming forth,</hi> 3 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo calleth Chriſtian Churches <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. and our Saviour divers times calleth his Church upon earth, <hi>the Kingdome of heaven;</hi> as

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42187:49"/>which had not in it an Altar, as a picture, ſign, or image of the Altar in heaven, and ſome ſacred pictures, ſignes or images, either to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto thoſe who ſhould enter into it the ſociety of heaven, or the myſteries of our faith, or both, otherwiſe it could not repreſent the Temple of God, or houſe of God in heaven, from whence it hath his denomination; S. <hi>John</hi> ſaying, <hi>that he ſaw a great multitude</hi> (in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) <hi>which no man could number, of all Nations, Tribes, and peoples, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in white robes, and palms in their hands, &amp;c. theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are they which are come out of great tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the bloud of the Lamb, therefore they are before the Throne of God, and they ſerve him day and night in his Temple, Revel.</hi> 7.

14.17. whereby it

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> That in time of peace, when there is no perſecution, the pictures and images of Angels and Saints ought to be placed in Chriſtian Churches, and there honored with a relative religious worſhip.</head>
               <p>AS I have proved in the laſt chapter, Chriſtian Churches, Temples and Chappels ought to reſemble unto them heaven, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42187:50"/>the houſe of God in heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in do dwell Angels and Saints, and therefore it is as manifeſt, that Chriſtians ought to have ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred pictures of Angels and Saints in their churches, temples and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, and there to honor them with a relative religious worſhip, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto them heaven, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that they ought to have chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, unleſſe it be in time of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when ſacred pictures are more ſubject to be prophaned, then the churches themſelves, by Pagans and Infidels, who do more hate ſacred images, then they do material chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and therefore doe ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and abuſe them, then they doe the churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>In the Old Teſtament, becauſe the gates of heaven were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before the Aſcenſion of our Lord, as the Scriptures witneſſe,
<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.18. therefore in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42187:51"/>and Temple of the Old Law, were onely the pictures of Angels, and not of Saints; but now in the New Law, that the Saints have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into heaven, and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of heaven doe conſiſt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, as witneſſe the Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.22.
<hi>Revel.</hi> 7.9. it is as requiſite that the pictures and images of Saints ſhould be placed in Chriſtian churches and chappels, and there reſpected and honored with a relative religious worſhip, as that it was neceſſary in the old Law the pictures of Angels ſhould be in the Tabernacle and Temple, and there reſpected and adored after the manner aforeſaid, the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſerving equally for both.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of the Temple and houſe of God in heaven, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of an innumerable multitude of Angels and Saints, he ſhould be but an unskilfull workman, who would undertake to make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42187:52"/>as doth witneſſe the Councell of
<hi>J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberis</hi> held in the time of of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and before the church had peace, in the thirty ſixth Canon, ſaying, <hi>It hath pleaſed the Councell that pictures ſhould not be in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> (that is to ſay, fixed or faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the walls) <hi>least that which is worſhipped and adored ſhould be paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon walls,</hi> where the Pagan and Infidels coming might eaſily abuſe them.</p>
               <p>But after that perſecution ceaſed, and the church had peace; for the ſtatues, pictures and images of falſe gods, and prophane men, which the Pagan and Infidells uſed in their Temples, and the honor which they beſtowed upon them, the Chriſtians brought in the pictures, images and memories of the Saints, with a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive religious reſpect and honor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as witneſſeth <hi>Theodoret</hi> in the end of the eighth book of the cure of Greek affections, or of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42187:52"/>ſaying, <hi>The Temples of thoſe falſe gods, and prophane men, together with their groves, are now ſo destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there doth not remain any of their footſteps, neither can we know after what manner their Attars were built, for the very matter of thoſe things is purged out, by the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Temples and Altars of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, for our Lord God hath brought in his dead into the Temples in place of your gods, he hath made their glory void and vain, and hath given their honor to his Martyrs; and for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of all your gods and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, are brought in the common feaſts of</hi> Peter, Paul, Thomas, Sergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Marcellus, Leontius, Antonius, Moritius, <hi>and other holy Martyrs.</hi> Thus <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who floriſhed in the year 430. to ſhew unto us, that as ſoon as the church had peace, the faithful kept the feaſts of the Saints, placed their pictures in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and gave unto them all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> How the Nurſe of Pious Thoughts doth not only conſiſt in the having and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacred pictures, ſignes and images, but alſo in giving unto them an outward and inward relative religious worſhip, not for the materiall things themſelves, but for the ſacred things which they repreſent.</head>
               <p>TO the preſervation of pious thoughts in our hearts, as I have ſaid heretofore, it is not only ſufficient often to hear ſacred artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſounds, and ſee or behold ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred artificiall pictures, ſignes and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, but alſo to honor, worſhip and reſpect them, with an outward and inward relative religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not for themſelves, or for the matter they are compounded of, but for the divine things and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our faith which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us, and as they do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them unto us, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for not only vitious and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42187:58"/>men, whoſe hearts are of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoughts, but alſo the divells themſelves hear, and ſee ſacred pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, ſignes and images, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the fourth of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where the divell both heard and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Scripture. And Mr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> a Proteſtant Miniſter, in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sermon preached at <hi>Grantham</hi> in the year 1634. §. 6. &amp; 8. telleth us of many Sectaries here in
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who are ſo addicted to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall viſible artificiall ſignes, and ſounds of the Bible, that <hi>to do any thing at all without directions from the written materiall Word</hi> (as they ſay)
<hi>is unlawfull and ſinfull, even ſo far, as for the taking up of a ſtraw:</hi> whereby it appeareth, that not the often hearing of ſacred artificial ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſigns, or ſeeing of ſacred artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial material pictures, ſigns or images only, is ſufficient to the begetting and nouriſhing of pious thoughts in the hearts of men, but alſo it is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42187:58"/>neceſſary, that we ſhould reverence and reſpect them with an outward &amp; inward relative religious worſhip and honor, for the things which they repreſent, as often as we heare or ſee them; ſo to worſhip them, not for the ſounds themſelves, or for the pictures, ſignes and images themſelves, or for the matter they are made of, but as they repreſent divine things unto us, and the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our faith, thereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and open our hearts for the worthy receiving of the knowledge of theſe ſacred things, and myſteries of our faith which they doe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to diſtinguiſh betweene ſacred pictures, ſigns and images, and prophane or civill.</p>
               <p>Firſt, honor and reverence towards any thing begetteth a great eſteem and love of the thing it ſelf in the heart of man; for as
<hi>Aristotle</hi> well obſerveth (in the eleventh chapter of his firſt book of Rhetorick) ſaith,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42187:59"/>
                  <hi>Honor and glory is of moſt pleaſing things;</hi> ſo that theſe things which we honor, we cannot but love, and love openeth the heart, and maketh a paſſage to the thing beloved; and when we honor, worſhip, or reſpect any thing which belongeth to God, or that may conduct us to God for Gods ſake, or as it belongeth or conducteth us to God, the honor endeth, or is terminated in God, and not in the thing honored: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (as I have ſaid heretofore) S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſo much honored the latchet of our Saviours ſhoes, for our Saviours ſake, that he thought himſelf not worthy to unlooſe it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.27. And the faithful Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion ſo greatly honored and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced our Saviours words for our Lords ſake (as that he ſaid) <hi>I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt enter under my roof, but only ſay the word, and my boy ſhall be healed, Mat.</hi> 8.8. In like manner, the woman which was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42187:59"/>with an iſſue of blood, ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed of our Saviours gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſhe ſaid, <hi>If I ſhall touch only his garment I ſhall be ſafe, Mat</hi> 9.1. And as alſo I have ſaid hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Primitive Chriſtians ſo highly eſteemed and honored the very ſhadow of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> for our Lords ſake, <hi>That they did bring forth the ſick into the ſtreets, and laid them in beds and couches, that when</hi> Peter <hi>came, his ſhadow at least might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow any of them. Act.</hi> 5.15. <hi>There were alſo brought from</hi> Paul <hi>his body, napkins or handkerchiefs upon the ſick, and the diſeaſes departed from them, Act.</hi> 19.12. of ſo great force was the relative religious worſhip that the faithfull gave unto the things which belonged unto God, or unto his ſervants, to indue them with pious thoughts, and a conſtant faith.</p>
               <p>Almighty God will not only have theſe things which immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto himſelf, to be honored
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42187:60"/>with a relative religious honor and worſhip for his ſake, but alſo theſe things which appertain unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom he alſo ſo highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, that he keepeth an accompt of every hair which groweth upon their heads, according to his word, ſaying,
<hi>your very hairs of the head are all numbered, Mat.</hi> 10.30. And if Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God will have the haires of his ſervants heads, which are but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, to be of ſo great eſteeme, who is there that is not exceeding proud, an enemy of his own good, that will deny an outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward relative religious worſhip to ſacred pictures, ſignes and images, as they are ſacred pictures, ſigns and images, and adminiſter unto our minds pious thoughts of heaven and heavenly things, ſeeing this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafteth and ſetleth in our hearts the knowledge of the pious things themſelves, which are repreſented by theſe pictures, ſigns and images,

               <p>TO let thee dear Reader moſt clearly and manifeſtly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how free Roman Catholiques are from committing Idolatry in the worſhip which they give to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred artificiall pictures, ſigns and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, I deſire thee firſt to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they call ſacred pictures, ſignes and images, theſe artificiall things, which repreſent unto them, either the things in heaven, or the myſteries of their faith, or the holy actions of our Saviour, or his Saints; &amp;c. and as they do repreſent them, theſe they call ſacred pictures, ſigns, and images, for the holy things they repreſent, and as they repreſent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42187:61"/>them; as God himſelfe called the artificiall things which did belong unto the Temple <hi>ſacred, Exod.</hi>
31. And ſecondly, that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them, not as they are abſolute things or ſubſtances, or as they are carved ſtocks, or ſtones, or painted cloaths, or creatures, this is but the falſe calumniations of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, (who whileſt they can find nothing that's evill in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which they can juſtly charge them withall, do impute that unto them, which they do not) but they worſhip them as they have relation to the aforeſaid known holy things, and either mediately or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduct their hearts and minds to God, the Author of all goodneſſe, as a mark, ſign or note which ſhould ſhew unto us a thing of greater worth, eminency or dignity then it ſelf, in ſuch ſort, as if it did ſay, <hi>J am none of your God, or laſt end,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I doe but repreſent only a thing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42187:61"/>more excellent then my ſelfe, like the ſtamp upon the coyn; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Saviour ſaid unto the Jewes, who ſhewed unto him the tribute money, <hi>whoſe is this image and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription? they ſay to him</hi> Caeſars; <hi>then he ſaith to them, render therefore the things that are</hi> Caeſars, <hi>to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.20.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſeeing that ſacred artificiall pictures, ſignes or images, do but tell us of things more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then themſelves, certainly as ſuch, and by theſe who eſteem them ſuch, they can neither be eſteemed or reputed as a God, or Gods, nor be as God worſhipped; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eſteemed, thought or imagined that to be a God, or worſhipped that for a God, which he affirmed to be but a ſhadow, or a relation unto another thing of greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, none who was endued with reaſon, ſeeing that every one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeth God to be the chiefeſt of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42187:62"/>all Gods, and the laſt end of all things, according to the words of our Lord, ſaying, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega,</hi> and <hi>I am the first and the laſt, Revel.</hi> 1.17.</p>
               <p>And <hi>de facto</hi> that any one doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem a thing to be a ſacred artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all picture, ſign or image, and doth worſhip it as a ſacred artificiall pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, ſigne or image of another thing, he doth deny it to be a God, or to worſhip it as a God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot commit idolatry unto it, by worſhipping it as a ſacred artificiall picture, ſigne or image.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as I have ſaid hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, an artificiall picture, ſigne, or image, about which the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is, as ſuch is neither ſubſtance, perſon, nor creature, nor ſo eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any one who is endued with reaſon, becauſe they are but the work of a Painter, Printer, Writer or Carver, who cannot make a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, perſon or creature, becauſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42187:62"/>they are reſerved to God alone; whereby alſo it is manifeſt, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Roman Catholiques do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſacred artificiall pictures, ſignes and images, as they are ſuch, and no otherwiſe, they cannot commit i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, becauſe idolatry is, when the honor and worſhip which is due unto God, as he is God and Creator of all things, is given unto another perſon, or unto a creature or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which Roman Catholiques acknowledge, and confeſſe ſacred artificiall ſignes, pictures and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are not: And what reaſonable man ever, either worſhipped or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, or eſteemed that for a God, which he publiquely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly profeſſed to be neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nor ſubſtance, nor yet ſo much as a creature; nor to have any ſubſiſtence of it ſelf: whereby you ſee that the clamours of ſome Sectaries againſt the idolatry of Roman Catholikes in the worſhipping of ſacred artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42187:63"/>pictures, ſignes, and images, are but as the cry and noyſe of frogs, which to hearken unto, do but dull mens ears, and hinder them of better thoughts.</p>
               <p>That Roman Catholiques do not honor or worſhip ſacred artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall pictures, ſignes or images, with any other honor or worſhip then relative, unto divine and heavenly things after the manner aboveſaid, is firſt manifeſt by the decree of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> which in the twenty fifth Seſſion ſaith, <hi>The image of Chriſt, of the Virgin Mother of God, and of other Saints, are to be had and retained, eſpecially in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that due honor and worſhip is to be imparted unto them, not for that any divinity is to be believed to be in them, or vertue, for which they are to be worſhipped, or that any thing is to be begged of them, or that hope is to be put in them, as in times paſt the Pagans did, who put their truſt in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42187:63"/>but becauſe the honor which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to them is referred unto the first patern which they reſemble; ſo that by the images which we kiſſe, and before which we uncover our heads, and kneel, we adore Christ and his Saints, whoſe likeneſſe they bear.</hi> Thus this Councell, to demonſtrate unto us, that even by the decree of this Councell, which all Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques are bound to follow, they honor, worſhip and reſpect ſacred artificiall pictures, ſignes and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with a relative honor and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip only, and no other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is yet further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that Roman Catholiques do not honor or worſhip ſacred artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall pictures, ſigns or images, with any other honor or worſhip but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative; for that though they worſhip pictures, yet they do not worſhip all pictures, ſigns or images, which they ſhould do, if they worſhipped pictures abſolutely, neither yet doe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42187:64"/>they worſhip the ſame ſignes, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures or images, when they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, or have relation unto other things, as appeareth in the name of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the materiall Temples and Altars of Jewes and Gentiles, which they repreſent, or have relation unto any other thing, then unto the living God, or Chriſt our Saviour, or the Temple, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar in heaven.</p>
               <p>As for example, though the third Commandement ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> and the Scriptures ſay, <hi>In the name of Jeſus every knee ſhall bow, Phil.</hi> 2 16. yet they do not worſhip the name of God, where it is ſaid to <hi>Moyſes, J will make thee God of</hi> Pharoah, <hi>Ezod.</hi> 7.1. nor the name of Jeſus, when it ſignifieth unto us, <hi>Jeſus the ſon of</hi> Nun,
<hi>or</hi> Joſhua, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.45. or Jeſus the ſon of
<hi>Sirach,</hi> writer of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> or the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Altars of Pagans or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42187:64"/>becauſe they want that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the living God, and things in heaven; whereby it is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Roman Catholiques give no other worſhip or honor unto ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred artificiall pictures, ſignes or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, but relative, as they induce them to think, and put them in mind of other things which are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and eminent then they, and whoever worſhipped or honored God with a relation unto another thing more excellent or eminent in dignity then he? or whoever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed that to be a God, which he reſpected and worſhipped with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto another thing, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in dignity then that which he worſhipped? whereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that Roman Catholikes neither do commit idolatry in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of ſacred artificiall pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, ſigns or images, as they do, neither can they, ſeeing that in the fact it ſelfe they demonſtrate, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42187:65"/>the pictures, ſigns or images which they worſhip, are no gods, nor yet ſo much as creatures, or ſubſtances, after the manner which they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them, nor yet have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much as any ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this is generally and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally the Tenet of all Roman Catholiques, that a materiall thing which hath neither life, ſenſe, nor reaſon, ſuch as is a carved or ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtock or ſtone, or painted cloth, of it ſelf, or by it ſelf, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or reference unto another thing, is not capable of any honor, worſhip, or reverence, much leſſe of a religious honor or worſhip, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is manifeſt that Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques do not worſhip ſtocks or ſtones, or painted cloaths nor gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor carved, nor painted things, as they are ſuch, or as they are things abſolute, but as they have relation to the things of heaven, and the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our faith, and ſtir up in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42187:65"/>their minds pious thoughts.</p>
               <p>And this is ſufficient to ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any indifferent Reader, how free Roman Catholiques are from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting either idolatry, or any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, in the honor and worſhip which they give unto ſacred artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall pictures, ſigns and images, and how their adverſaries do calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate them herein unjuſtly, not only to the breach of the peace, concord and charity which ſhould be amongſt the natives of this Iſland of
<hi>Great Britain,</hi> but alſo to the great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the elevation of mens minds to heavenly things and pious thoughts, for the which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them.</p>

               <p>Again, as I have ſaid here before,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42187:70"/>men cannot change eſſences and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, becauſe theſe things belong to God, but they have changed the Sabbath, from Saturday unto Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, as our Adverſaries do confeſſe, whereby it is demonſtrated, that that the Sabbath day is but a ſacred ſign of reſt from the Creation of the world, as alſo of the eternall reſt of heaven, and of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Lord, and of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; &amp;c. whereby they might be diſtinguiſhed from other Nations, and yet our adverſaries themſelves do honor reverence this day after their kind or manner with a religious worſhip, though it be but a ſign, and no ſubſtance, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or God; neither may they ſay, that this ſanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, may be, or is performed by a civill worſhip, ſeeing that firſt the Commandements of God, as I have ſaid heretofore, are divine and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and pertaine to Religion.

               <p>Moreover, that the Sabbath day or Sunday is but a ſign or ceremony to put us in mind of another thing, God himſelf doth yet further wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſaying, <hi>See that you keep my Sabbath, becauſe it is a ſign betweene me and you in your generations, that you may know that J am the Lord which ſanctifie you, keep you my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, for it is holy unto you, he that polluteth it, dying, ſhall dye, Exod.</hi> 31.13. to demonſtrate unto us, that the Sabbath or Sunday is but a ſigne, to diſtinguiſh the people of God and faithfull from the Infidells and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and yet all faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple worſhip and honor it with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn rites, ceremonies and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as offering of Sacrifice, reſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42187:71"/>from labour, attending to proper preaching, reading of the Scriptures, and other pious works and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo that it cannot be denied, but that ſacred ſignes, pictures, images, and ſuch things as repreſent unto us, or have relation, either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately or mediately unto divine things, or to the things of heaven, or myſteries of our faith, may be honored and worſhipped with a relative religious honor and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for the things of heaven, or holy things which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, and that this relative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip begetteth in us pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts, ſeeing God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</p>

               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:42187:72"/>
               <p>The cauſe why Almighty God ſo preſſeth man to ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, which is but a ſign of the reſt which he made from the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, and of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Reſurrection, and of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſt in heaven, with a relative religious worſhip, is becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worſhip this ſacred ſign of the Creation of the World, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour, and eternall reſt in heaven, without thinking upon theſe things, and begetting in our hearts pious thoughts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, Reſurrection of our Saviour, and eternall joyes of heaven; the Sabbath being a holy ſign of thoſe ſacred myſteries, as words are of things; when we worſhip this ſigne with a relative religious worſhip for thoſe things which it doth repreſent, we cannot but think upon the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe (as I have ſaid here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) we cannot think upon two

               <p>And to conclude, God ſpeaking of the obſervation of the feaſt of <hi>Easter,</hi> or <hi>Paſche,</hi> ſaith, <hi>The firſt day of the Paſche ſhall be holy and ſolemn, and the ſeventh day with the like fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivity ſhall be venerable, Exod.</hi> 12.16.

               <p>From hence it is that <hi>Abulenſis</hi> upon the twentieth chapter of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That it is a greater-ſin to take the name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>in vain, then that of God.</hi> And giving a reaſon, addeth, <hi>The common and laudable cuſtome of the Church, doth more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that name of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>then this of God: From whence it is that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout faithfull people, as ſoon as they hear the name of</hi> Jeſus,
<hi>either bow down their heads, or bend their knees, which they do not when they hear the name of God; he therefore who doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt this cuſtome, diſhonoring the name of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>doth commit a greater ſin, then he who diſhonoreth
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42187:79"/>the name of God.</hi> Thus
<hi>Abulenſis,</hi> of the outward and inward relative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious honor and worſhip which the Church of God hath alwayes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the name of
<hi>Ieſus,</hi> becauſe it is the proper name of the Word Incarnate, and of God, as he is our Redeemer, a name ſo much hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as that he not only hath it 219. times in his Epiſtles, but alſo the faithfull perſwading him, with many tears, that he would not go to
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> becauſe as the Prophet <hi>Agabus</hi> had foretold, there he was to be taken priſoner, and to be caſt into bands by the Jewes; he anſwered, <hi>I am ready, not only to be bound, but to die alſo in Hieruſalem for the name of our Lord</hi> Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13.</p>
               <p>After the people of Iſrael were conducted by God through the red Sea, and delivered out of the hands of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and the Egyptians,
<hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſaith, <hi>that they ſung thy

If this the faithfull in the Old Law did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were preſerved out of the hands of their temporall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by the paſſage through the red Sea, how much more ought Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſing and extoll the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> who by the red Sea of his bloud, hath redeemed us from our infernall enemies, and ſay with the Prophet; <hi>All Nations ſhall glorifie thy name becauſe thou art great, and doing marvellous things, thou only art God; conduct me O Lord in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth, let my heart rejoyce, that I may fear thy name, I will confeſſe to thee O Lord my God with all my heart, and I will glorifie thy name for ever, becauſe thy mercy is great upon me, and thou hast delivered my ſoul from the lower hell, Pſal.</hi> 85.9. <hi>O Lord our Lord, how marvellous is thy name in the whole earth! Pſal.</hi>
8.10. <hi>becauſe thou haſt magnified above every thing thy holy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42187:80"/>name, Pſal.</hi> 137.2. the name of
<hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> which is magnified above all names or temporall things: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon S. <hi>Hilarius</hi> upon this Pſalme ſaith, <hi>J have manifested thy name to men; and what name this was, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, ſaying, Father the hour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, cauſe thy ſon to be honored, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adoreth this name.</hi> Now if the Prophet did adore the name of God, not for the materiall letters or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, but for that it repreſented unto him an infinite goodneſſe and greatneſſe; why ſhould we now doubt, whether we ought to adore and worſhip holy names, pictures, and ſignes, which conduct us unto the ſame God with a relative religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip, ſeeing that it doth fill our ſouls with pious thoughts.</p>
               <p>Again, the ſame Saint ſaith upon the ſame Pſalm, <hi>He confeſſeth the Word made fleſh in truth, and the cauſe of his confeſſion is taken from this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt magnified above every

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arnobius</hi> alſo expounding this Pſalm, ſaith,
<hi>The Prophet doth confeſs unto his name, becauſe in the name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>every knee ſhall bow, of the things in heaven, of the things upon earth, and of theſe things under the earth, and what doth he confeſſe unto his holy name? he ſaith, thy mercy, and thy truth: A ſoul doth confeſſe nothing elſe to God in the ſight of the Angels, but the mercy wherewith he is redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42187:81"/>and the truth which he is taught; what truth? without all doubt this, wherein his holy name is magnified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, for this is a name which is above all names.</hi> Thus theſe Fathers of the relative religious ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, reſpect, &amp; reverence which the faithful in their times bare unto this ſacred name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth Chriſt our Lord, and all his mercies, and putteth into their minds pious thoughts.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, the relative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious reſpect which the Primitive Chriſtians bare unto this ſacred name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was ſuch, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> an antient Father, who lived above eleven hundred years paſt, in his Commentaries upon the forty fourth of
<hi>Eſay</hi> affirmeth, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be imprinted with an hot iron upon their bodies; and now the world is aſcended to that height of pride, that there are found men who will not call themſelvs Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42187:82"/>and yet not vouchſafe either to uncover their heads, or bend their knees, or incline their ſtiffe necks at this ſacred name, to verifie upon them the prophecy of S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>In the laſt times men ſhall be haughty, proud, ſtubborn, puffed up, and lovers of voluptuouſneſſe more then of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.

               <p>AS this name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth our Saviour, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and glorious both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, ſo alſo when it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with a relative religious worſhip, it is a name of terror and fear unto the divells, whoſe place is to live under the earth, in ſuch ſort, that not only in the time of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the Diſciples by vertue of his name, and power given unto it, caſt divells out of the bodies of men, when returning from preaching they ſaid, <hi>Lord alſo the divells are ſubject unto us in thy name, Luke</hi> 10.17. And our Saviour ſaid, <hi>I ſaw Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan as lightning fall from heaven,</hi> but alſo at all times the divells are to be caſt out of the bodies of men, by
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42187:83"/>vertue of this name, pronounced or uſed with a relative religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, according to the words of our Lord, ſaying, <hi>Them that believe, theſe ſigns ſhall follow, in my name ſhall they cast out divells, Mark</hi> 16.17. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he would caſt an evill ſpirit or divel out of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſaid no more, <hi>but I command thee in the name of Ieſus Chriſt to goe out of her, and he went out at the ſame hour, Act.</hi> 16.18.</p>
               <p>And it was ſo common a thing in the time of the Apoſtles for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the faithfull, by vertue of the name of Jeſus, as it repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt our Lord, to caſt divells out of the bodies of men, that in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation thereof, <hi>certain alſo of the Judais all Exorcists went about, &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to invocate upon them that had evill ſpirits the name of our Lord</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſaying, <hi>I adjure you by</hi> Ieſus
<hi>whom</hi> Paul <hi>preacheth, Act.</hi> 19.13. And our Saviour affirmeth, that many
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42187:83"/>ſhall appear before him after their death, who in pretence of right to their ſalvation, will ſay, <hi>Have not we in thy name cast out devels? Mat.</hi> 7.22. To demonſtrate unto us, that not onely the faithfull ſhall at all times honor and worſhip the name of Ieſus, as it repreſenteth unto us Chriſt our Lord, but alſo many wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men and reprobates, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells themſelves, though againſt their wills.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> lived with the Apoſtles Scholars, and was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Martyr; yet he in his firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Chriſtians unto the Roman Senate, before the middeſt, ſaith unto the Senators,
<q rend="margQuotes">Many of our men, who are called Chriſtians, both throughout the world, and even in this City, adjuring them by the name of Ieſus Chriſt, who was crucified under the Pretor <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> have cured many, who were poſſeſſed of divells, when by
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42187:84"/>no other Exorciſts, or any Magiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans they could find remedy, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at this day they do cure, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and driving the divells out of their bodies.</q> S. <hi>Antonius,</hi> as affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his life, not only with the name of Jeſus often put the divell to flight, but alſo taught <hi>Martinianus</hi> a prefect of ſouldiers to diſpoſſeſſe his daughter by invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the name of Jeſus, with a relative religious worſhip unto it.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Hierome</hi> writing the life of S. <hi>Hilarion</hi> ſaith,
<q rend="margQuotes">That on a night he heard as it were the crying of infants; the bleating of ſheep, the bellowing of beaſts, the mourning of women, the wring of Lions, the noyſe of an army, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of barbarous voyces, that being firſt affrighted by the outcries, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, he might be moved to fly at the ſight; but underſtanding that theſe were policies of the divell, caſting himſelf upon his knees, he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42187:84"/>made the ſigne of the Croſſe of Chriſt upon his forehead, armed with ſuch a helmet, and compaſſed about with the breſt-plate of faith, remaining in his poſture, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring after a manner to ſee him whom he did abhor to hear; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he carefully caſt his eyes on all ſides, upon a ſuddaine the Moone ſhining, he ſee a Chariot drawn with fiery horſes to ruſh upon him; whereat when he had cryed out Jeſus, even before his eys, of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain all this pomp was ſwallowed up at a chink into the earth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> the Deacon writeth of S. <hi>Abraham</hi> an Ermite in <hi>Syria,</hi> that ſinging Pſalmes at midnight, of a ſuddaine a beautifull light ſhined in his Cell, and a voice was heard, as it were of a multitude; ſaying,
<q rend="margQuotes">Bleſſed art thou <hi>Abraham,</hi> thou art truly bleſſed and faithfull, there is none found like thee amongſt men, who haſt done whatſoever I have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42187:85"/>deſired; forthwith the holy man knowing the craft of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirit, with a loud voice ſaid, O full of deceipt and policy, thy darkneſſe be to thee in perdition, for I am a poor ſinner, yet armed with the ſhield of hope through the grace of God I nothing fear thy treacheries, neither do thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny phantaſies affright me, for the name of my Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whom I have loved, and do love, is to me a ſtrong fortreſſe, in which name I check thee, filthy, and thrice miſerable dog. At which words preſently, as ſmoak, the divell vaniſhed out of his ſight.</q> Whereby it appeareth, that the divells feare this very name of Jeſus, as it hath relation to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and do fly away when it is ſpoken, with honor, faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that for his name ſake he will protect us.</p>
               <p>Almighty God being favourable
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42187:85"/>unto all thoſe who love and honor his name, it hath alwaies beene thought a good prayer to ſay, <hi>For thy name ſake thou wilt be propitious to my ſin, for it is much, Pſal.</hi> 24.11.

               <p>THis name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath alwayes amongſt the Chriſtians beene a name of ſo great a relative religious honor and worſhip, that by vertue of it, as it repreſenteth <hi>Chriſt</hi> our

               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> not only did miracles by vertue of this name, as it hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Saviour, whileſt he lived, as I have ſhewed heretofore, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as it is related by conſtant Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at his death when his head was cut off; it gave three rebounds or leaps, and three times repeated this ſacred name of Jeſus, whereat three fountains guſhed out, which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main untill this day, and was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous,

                  <hi>Surius</hi> in the life of S. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who lived long with the Apoſtles, writeth, that being urged by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to deny Jeſus Chriſt (as their cuſtome was in them times) anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>that it was a thing impoſſible for him to do, becauſe it was ingraven in his heart,</hi> which after death they cut in pieces, and found to be true, his heart every where expreſſing in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages the name of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in the third chapter of his ſeventeenth book of hiſtories writeth, that there being a great Earthquake at

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42187:87"/>their doors, Jeſus <hi>is with us, let no man move from his place,</hi> &amp; they, &amp; their houſes eſcaped, and ſtood firm.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, a man of no little credit in the Church of God, in the firſt chapter of his firſt book of Dialogues writeth, that <hi>Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> a holy man built a Monaſtery neer to the City of
<hi>Pundi</hi> amongſt the Alps, where he had almoſt two hundred Monks under him, and a mighty great ſtone breaking from under the hill, under which his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery was built, came rouling down, as if it would deſtroy both his Monaſtery and Monks, which the holy man <hi>Honoratus</hi> ſeeing, he often called upon the name of Chriſt (which was Jeſus) and with his right hand made the ſign of the croſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and ſo ſtaid it preſently, even in the declining of the ſide of the Mountain.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſame S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in the third chapter of the ſame book, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42187:87"/>another miracle which was done by vertue of the ſame ſacred name of Jeſus, which was as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, certain Monks had an Orchard of fruits and herbs for their proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with a Lay-brother, a holy man for the Gardner, into which a thief uſed to break for to ſteal away the fruit and herbs, which the pious Lay-brother perceiving the loſſe, looking about, found the place where he paſſed over the pale, and ſeeking for a remedy, found a Serpent, whom he commanded, ſaying, <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me,</hi> which the Serpent did, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he came to the paſſage which the thief uſed, and then ſaid to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>I command thee in the name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>that thou keep this paſſage, and do not permit the thief to enter here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more;</hi> preſently the Serpent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her ſelf along the paſſage, and the Lay-brother returned to his Cell.

And then looſing the thiefs foot, without doing him any hurt, he ſaid, <hi>how durſt thou brother ſo often ſteal the labours of the Monks, follow me.</hi> And ſo conducting him to the gate of the Orchard with much courteſie, he gave him the fruit and herbs which he would have ſtollen, ſaying, <hi>Go thy way, and hereafter do not ſteal, but if thou ſhalt be in want, come hither unto me, and that which now thou laboureſt to take away by ſtealth, I will freely give unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover it was ſo common a

               <p>SO great is the obligation which all mankind hath unto the Son of God for his death and paſſion upon the Croſſe, for their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from everlaſting pains; that as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, he who is not thankfull to God for his creation, is worthy to go to hell, but he who is not willing to have a pious mind, and thankfull remembrance for his redemption, is worthy to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hell created for his greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whereupon all pious faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians have ever born a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable relative religious worſhip unto the ſacred ſign or image of the Croſſe, not as it is a piece of wood or ſtone, or painted cloth, or action
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42187:90"/>of the hand, but as it repreſenteth unto our memories the ſacred paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Lord, as words do things, and indueth our minds with pious thoughts; whereupon S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of the holy Croſſe, ſaith; <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory, but in the Croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Christ, Gal.</hi> 6: 14. And complaining of the little reſpect and reverence which the carnall men of his time bore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſacred Croſſe of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>Obſerve them that walk, as you have ſeen our form, for many walk, of whom I often told you, (and now weeping al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I tell you) enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is the belly, and their glory in their confuſion, Phil.</hi> 3.17. where he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us to underſtand, that to be a lover and honorer of the ſacred Croſſe of Chriſt, as it repreſenteth unto us his paſſion for us, is a ſigne of election, and the neglect a token of perdition, which alſo in another
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42187:90"/>place he confirmeth, ſaying, <hi>The word of the croſſe to them indeed that periſh is fooliſhneſſe but to them that are ſaved, that is to us, it is the power of God,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe at the later day, when Almighty God ſhall ſend his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells to deſtroy the earth and Sea, to make a diſtinction betweene the ſervants of God, and the followers of Antichriſt, he will give them a command, that all the Elect ſhall be marked with the ſign of the Croſſe, that thereby they may be knowne from the Rebrobate, as witneſſeth S. <hi>John</hi> ſaying, <hi>I ſaw an Angell aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from the riſing of the Sun, having the ſign of the living God, and he cryed with a loud voice to the four Angells, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the ſea, ſaying, hurt not the earth, or the ſea, nor the trees, untill we ſign the ſervants of our God in their foreheads.</hi> Thus S.
<hi>John, Rev.</hi> 7.2. whereupon <hi>Andreas</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42187:91"/>of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in
<hi>Cappadocia,</hi> an antient learned Author, in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon the Revelations, ſaith upon this text, <hi>This place, as is before ſaid, doth belong unto the time of Antichrist, when the ſigne of the quickning croſſe</hi> (vivificae crucis) <hi>ſhall diſtinguiſh the faithfull from the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells, who ſhall without any feare, and without any ſhame, carry the Croſſe of Chriſt before the face of the impious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Antichriſt, to blot out the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſacred croſſe, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men from ſigning themſelves with it, and from uſing any reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or reſpect unto it, ſhall cauſe all his followers to have his name, or the character of his name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in their right hand, or in their forehead; that if they would ſigne themſelves with the ſacred ſigne of the croſſe, in teſtimony that they believe the bleſſed Trinity, and march under the protection of Chriſt crucified, they cannot, as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42187:91"/>witneſſeth S. <hi>John,</hi> ſaying,
<hi>Antichriſt ſhall make all, little and great, and rich, and poor, and freemen, and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to have a character in their right hand, or in their foreheads; and that no man may buy or ſell, but he that hath the character or name of the beaſt, or number of his name, Rev.</hi> 13.16. And this Antichriſt ſhall do, as witneſſeth S. <hi>Hypolitus</hi> a Martyr, who ſuffered death for the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Catholique faith, about fourteen hundred yeares paſt; <hi>leaſt that any man with his right hand ſhould make the ſign of the Croſſe in his forehead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like hath S. <hi>Ephrem,</hi> who flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed not long after him, in his Tract of Antichriſt, ſaying;
<q rend="margQuotes">Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt will imprint his character in the right hand, and forehead of all his followers, that it may not be poſſible for any with his right hand to ſign himſelf with the ſign of Chriſt our Saviour; or by any
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42187:92"/>means to imprint the terrible and holy name of God in his forehead; or the glorious and fearfull Croſſe of our Saviour; for that wretch will know very well, that by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Croſſe of our Lord all his power is made void: And therfore he will have his character imprinted in the right hand of men; becauſe we with our right hands do ſign the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our bodies with the ſigne of the Croſſe.</q> Thus S. <hi>Ephrem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, our Saviour will have the ſigne of the croſſe, as it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth him crucified, to be had in ſuch honor and reverence amongſt the ſons of men, that when he ſhall come to judge quick and the dead, it ſhall appeare before him in the ayre, as his ſtandard, as himſelf wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, ſaying, <hi>Immediately after the tribulation of theſe dayes</hi> (of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt) <hi>the Sun ſhall be darkened, and the Moon ſhall not give her light,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42187:92"/>Stars ſhall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven ſhall be moved; and then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of man in heaven, Mat.</hi> 24.36. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon S. <hi>Methodius</hi> in his Oration of the conſummation of the world, ſaith,
<q rend="margQuotes">The ſign of the Croſs exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in brightneſs &amp; glory the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sun, ſhall be ſeen from the Eaſt unto the Weſt, to tell the appearing &amp; coming of the Judge.</q> In like manner S <hi>Chryſostome</hi> upon this text ſaith;
<q rend="margQuotes">Then ſhall appeare the ſigne of the Son of Man, that is to ſay, the Croſſe it ſelf; for the Croſſe ſhall be ſeen more bright then the Sun; for, the Sun ſhall be darkened, and the Croſſe ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, which cannot be (ſaith he) but the Croſs with his brightneſſe muſt obſcure the beams of the Sun.</q> And then asking the queſtion, why, or for what cauſe ſhall the ſacred Croſſe appear ſo glorious? anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>That it may abundantly confound
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42187:93"/>the impudency of the Jewes.</hi> Thus S.
<hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who never could i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that there would ariſe men, who ſhould call themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and yet abuſe, contemne, and beat down the Croſſe of Chriſt: Whither will theſe men run at the terrible day of judgment, who now not only ſhun and avoid by all means the Croſs of Chriſt, but alſo call the reverend relative religious reſpect thereof idolatry?</p>
               <p>In like manner S. <hi>Ephrem,</hi> in his Sermon of theſe things, which are to be revealed after the appearing of the Croſſe, at the coming of our Lord, ſaith, <hi>The ſigne of the Son of Man ſhall appear in heaven, with a multitude of Angells, lightening the whole earth above the brightneſſe of the Sun, even from one end of the world unto the other, foretelling the coming of our Lord.</hi> And with theſe further do agree
<hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Euthemius</hi> upon this text, ſaying,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42187:93"/>
                  <hi>Then the croſſe ſhall appeare, ſhining more bright then the Sun.</hi> Again, <hi>the Croſſe ſhall then be far more glorious then the Sun,</hi> which when the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who in this life have had averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the ſacred croſſe ſhall ſee, then as our Saviour there ſaith, <hi>ſhall they weep and bewaile their follies,</hi> when it is too late.</p>
               <p>Agreeable unto this which hath been ſaid, the holy Church in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the croſſe doth ſay, <hi>This ſign of the croſſe ſhall be in heaven, when our Lord ſhall come to judgement,</hi> and the Sibils in the end of their ſixth book do ſing;</p>

               <p>ALmighty God having beſtowed that honor and dignity upon the croſſe, as not only to be a ſacred ſign of the paſſion of his onely Son for our redemption, but alſo to be a badge of a Chriſtian; and his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, when he ſhall come with his Army of Angells and Saints to judgement, as I have proved in the precedent chapter. The antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Primitive Church, and all the faithfull, ever bare an inward and outward relative religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, honor, and worſhip to that ſacred ſign, image, or picture, not as it is a ſtock or ſtone, or painted cloth, or carved or painted thing, but as it repreſenteth the perſon of our Lord, his ſacred paſſion or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42187:95"/>of our faith unto our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as words do things.

(in the ſecond §. of his ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his book of <hi>Eccleſiasticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchy</hi>) relateth unto us, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the religious rites, and holy myſteries of Baptiſm, the ſacred ſign of the croſſe was ſo much honored, that it was often uſed, even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thrice together, and in the fifth chapter of the ſaid book and ſecond §. ſpeaking of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of orders, or conſecration of Clergy men, he ſaith, <hi>The Biſhop who conſecrateth them, doth imprint upon every one of thoſe whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrateth the ſign of the croſſe.</hi>

<q rend="margQuotes">Remember the croſs of our Lord, upon which you believe the true God, and Son of God ſuffered, keep it in your mind, ſpeak often of it, and have it in the ſign; for the croſſe of our Lord is your invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble armor againſt Satan, a helmet defending your head, a breaſtplate protecting your breaſt, a ſhield dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving back again the darts of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant enemies, a ſword which by no means will ſuffer the iniquity,

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42187:96"/>when we go to bed, when we ſit down, and in every thing which we do, we tear our foreheads with the ſign of the croſſe, but if you expect a text out of Scripture for theſe, and other ſuch like obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thou ſhalt find none, tradition will be pretended to be the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cuſtome the confirmer, and faith the obſerver.</q> Again in the 22. chapter of his third book againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> he ſaith,
<q rend="margQuotes">The Croſſe is the Greek letter

               <p>S. <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great floriſhed about the year 370. who in his Oration of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42187:100"/>the Martyr <hi>Gordian,</hi> ſaith,
<hi>He forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf with the ſign of the croſs, and ſo with great conſtancy of mind, without any fear or changing of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, went merrily to his death.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in the twenty ſeventh chapter of his book of the Holy Ghoſt, he ſaith, <hi>If we ſhould go about to rèject theſe cuſtomes, which are not delivered in writing, as though they were things of no moment, we ſhould imprudently condemn many things, which in the Goſpell are eſteemed neceſſary to our ſalvation, of which ſort is (that I may repeat that firſt, which is the first and moſt common thing uſed amongſt us)</hi> (the ſign of the croſs) <hi>for who hath taught in writing, that we ſhould ſigne thoſe with the ſign of the croſs, who have put their hope in Chriſt; is it not by a tacit and ſecret tradition? is it not from the doctrine which our Fathers have kept in ſilence, which curious and idle people call in queſtion?</hi>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42187:101"/>the iniquity of the divell is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away, and tempeſts of winds ceaſe; and alſo the good husbandman when he prepareth his land by tillage, and ſeeketh nouriſhment for life, he doth not begin to go about it, but by the ſign of the croſs.</hi> S.
<hi>Hierome</hi> chapter 6. of his eighth Epiſtle to <hi>Demetriades</hi> ſaith,

               <p>And to conclude, ſo honorable was the eſteeme which the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians had of the ſigne of the croſs, as that they uſed it in all the rites and ceremonies of their Religion, in ſuch ſort, as that they accompted no ſolemne act of their Religion to be well and perfectly performed, unleſs the ſacred ſigne of the croſs was added unto it, as witneſſeth S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> for the Greek church, who in his fifty fifth Homily upon S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith,
<q rend="margQuotes">All things which help to our ſalvation are perfected by the Croſſe; for when we are regenerated, the Croſſe of our Lord is preſent, when we are nouriſhed with the moſt ſacred meat, when we take orders; every where, and alwayes that ſign of victory is at hand.</q> Thus S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi> for the Greek church.

Neither could the adoration of the croſs become practiſed allover the Chriſtian world in few yeares, if at any time it had not been ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſtians, as we ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the contrary doctrine taught by the Sectaries, who have laboured againſt it, now about 80. years, and yet have prevailed but in ſome corners of the North part of the world only; whereby it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the croſs repreſenting our Redemption upon it, hath at all

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVI:</hi> Of the enemies of the Croſſe, and ſacred Images, and of the miſeries that befell Images, and of the miſeries that befell them.</head>
               <p>THe firſt enemy that the croſs had was Satan, who lived long with the Apoſtles, who as S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the
<hi>Phillipenſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Before the croſs was framed, the divel laboured that it might be made, and to that purpoſe he wrought with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience, in</hi> Judas, <hi>in the Phariſees, in the Sadduces, in old men, in young, in the Prieſts; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the croſs was finiſhed, he was troubled, moved</hi> Judas <hi>to repent, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a halter, and taught him how to hang himſelfe with it; he terrified and troubled the ſame woman in her ſleep,</hi> (that is to ſay)
<hi>Pilates</hi> wife, ſpoken of in the 27. of S. <hi>Mathew, and he endeavoured that they ſhould ceaſe from crucifying, who before had laboured by all means, that the ſame
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42187:115"/>croſs ſhould be had in a readineſſe, not that he repented him of ſo great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, for ſo he ſhould have beene leſs wicked; but now he begun to apprehend his own deſtruction, for the croſs of Chriſt was to be the chiefeſt cauſe of his condemnation, death, and perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore he worketh it in many that they ſhould deny the croſs, and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the paſſion, and affirme that Chriſt taſted death only in opinion, &amp;c. for the divel is divers and ſundry ways the author of all evill, deceiving mens minds by falſe reaſons.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> to demonſtrate unto us, that the firſt enemy of the croſs was the divel.</p>
               <p>The ſecond enemies of the croſs were the Jewes, who as S.
<hi>Ignatius</hi> in the ſame place before cited af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, the divell
<hi>ſtirred up to deny the croſs,</hi> who alſo unto this day remain reprobate.</p>
               <p>The third were the Gentiles, whom as the ſaid S.
<hi>Jgnatius</hi> in the ſame place affirmeth, calumniated
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42187:116"/>the croſs of witchcraft, or inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as divers do at this day.</p>
               <p>The fourth were certaine Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Chriſtians and Apoſtates, who in the Apoſtles times fell from the faith, denied the croſs, and put their whole felicity in ſenſuall life, and carnall pleaſure, of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>Many walk, whom often I have told you of (and now weeping, alſo I tell you) enemies of the croſs of Christ, whoſe end is deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe God is the belly, and their glory in their confuſion, who mind worldly things, Phil.</hi> 3.18. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> againſt certaine Heretikes, who in his time were enemies of the croſs of Chriſt, and gave themſelves to luxury, gluttony, and ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, caſting off abſtinence, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, continency, mortification, and auſtere life, which the croſſe doth teach us, which hereſie then took root, not onely in <hi>Juda,</hi> but in <hi>Greece,</hi> in divers of his Epiſtles

               <p>Again, our Saviour ſaith to the Jewes, <hi>Search the Scriptures, Joh.</hi> 5.39. with that honor, care and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that they ought to be ſearched into: for, as S. <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> in his Sermon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, he ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures, do not corrupt them: ſearch them not onely by reading them, but carefully inquiring after the ſenſe: God gave indeed the ſacred letters or characters, but he laid not open their contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42187:128"/>and kneele before images.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So our adverſaries pray before their Bibles, and kneel before their books, yet I do not think that they believe their Bible, or other Prayer-books to be Gods.</p>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42187:129"/>muſt either have no Bible, or a Bible of pictures, and images; and if our adverſaries will allow them to have an holy Bible, and ſacred Scriptures, then they muſt alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of holy pictures and ſacred i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, diſtinct from prophane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Images and idols are all one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> How abſurd this is, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Scriptures, which ſay, <hi>Chriſt is the image of the inviſible God, Col.</hi> 15. <hi>God created man to his own image, to the image of God he created him, Gen.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Adam lived</hi> 130. <hi>years, and begat to his own image and likeneſſe, Gen.</hi> 5.3. <hi>man is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. And if images and idols be all one, then the Chriſtians in Egypt and China when they put forth Bibles, ſet forth idols, and when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or reverence their Bibles or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, they worſhip idols; which how abſurd it is, I leave to the piety of the Reader. Again, many
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42187:129"/>idols are no images, as trees, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, unto which the Heathen offered Sacrifice, as unto their gods; whereby they made them idols, which yet were no images.</p>
               <p>Moreover images and idols differ in this: Firſt; that idols, as they are idols, had no truth at all in nature, but were feigned things, all our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred images have ſome eſtentiall truth extant, either in heaven or earth, which they repreſent. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, all idols are without truth, concerning faith and religion; all our images contain ſuch a truth as belongeth to Chriſtian faith or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Thirdly, Sacrifice was offered to idols, but we never offer ſacrifice to any image or picture. Fourthly i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, as they are idols, were either images of wicked men, or creatures not worthy of honor; ours of our Saviour and his Saints, who are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of worſhip and honor; whereby it appeareth that ſacred images and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols are not all one.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Roman Catholiques adore, kneel before, and worſhip their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as the heathen did their idols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The heathen, at leaſt for the moſt part, adored, kneeled, and worſhipped the materiall carved piece of wood, or ingraven ſtone, or molten image, or painted cloth, as a God, as witneſſe the Scriptures, ſaying, <hi>make us gods, that may go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, Exod.</hi>
32.1. Againe, <hi>he cut down Cedars &amp;c. and kindled them, and baked bread, but of the reſt he wrought a god, and adored, Iſa.</hi> 44.15. Againe,
<hi>Balthaſar the King made a great feaſt to his Nobles, &amp;c. and they praiſed their gods of gold, and of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of braſſe, of iron, and of wood, and of ſtone, Daniel</hi> 5.4. whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God himſelfe ſaid to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, that when they ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to idolatry, <hi>you ſhall ſerve gods that were framed with mens hands, wood &amp; ſtone that ſee not, Deut.</hi> 4.18. But as I have ſaid heretofore, no Roman
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42187:130"/>Catholique either eſteemeth or thinketh any ſacred image to be a God, or adoreth or kneeleth to it, or worſhippeth it as a God; if he ſhould, he ſhould ceaſe to be a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholique, and become an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell. Again, the heathen termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their adoration, kneeling, and worſhipping in their idolls, as in their laſt end, God and chiefeſt good, as is before ſhewed; Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques adore and kneel before their ſacred pictures, and worſhip their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages onely as remembrances of holy things, and neither as gods, or as things which containe any God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, nor yet as before an abſolute thing, creature or perſon. Thirdly, they offered ſacrifice unto their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, as witneſſe the Scriptures, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>They have made to themſelves a molten calf, and have adored, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated hoſts unto it, Exod.</hi> 32.8. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>They ſacrificed to the idols of Canaan, Pſal.</hi> 105.38. The Roman
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42187:131"/>Catholiques never offer ſacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any picture, or image whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Some of you ſay, that the ſame honor is due unto the image, which is due unto the example, but Chriſt, as you confeſs, is to be adored with divine honor, or honor of <hi>latria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whatſoever any of ours for diſputation ſake ſhall ſay in this point, yet they all ſubmit their judgements to the church, which in the 7. Act of the ſeventh Generall Councell hath decreed, that the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Chriſt is not to be honored with divine honor, and in the third Canon of the laſt Act, that the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Chriſt is no otherwiſe to be adored, then is the books of the Goſpell: and before theſe Councels, to worſhip the image of Chriſt with divine honor, was condemned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us for hereſie, as witneſſeth S. <hi>Jrenaeus</hi> in the 24. cha. of his. 1. book of hereſies, S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his 27 he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the 7. hereſie
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42187:131"/>of his book <hi>ad quod vult Deus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So firſt no Chriſtian Catholique ever affirmed that it was lawfull to offer exteriour viſible ſacrifice to the image of Chriſt our Lord. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, theſe men do not ſay that the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Chriſt, as it is the image of Chriſt, and as it is ſeparated from Chriſt, may by it ſelfe independent of Chriſt be worſhipped with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honor, but as it is one thing with Chriſt, or is reduced to Chriſt, as the garments of a King are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the King, or as the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, beauty or proportion of a body is coherent to a body; and ſo by a ſubtill diſtinction they may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture defend, that the image of Chriſt may by accident, or reductive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be honored with the ſame honor that Chriſt our Lord is honored, though not of it ſelfe, or by it ſelfe, for all Roman Catholiques do hold, that a thing which hath neither life, ſenſe, nor reaſon, (ſuch as is an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42187:132"/>image or picture of it ſelfe, and in regard of it ſelfe) is neither worthy of any honor, nor capable; and therefore though theſe Roman Catholiques do differ in words, and ſubtill diſtinctions, yet they agree in ſubſtance, effect, and meaning, and ſay, that the croſs or picture of our Saviour, as it is a molten, or graven, or painted thing, &amp; hath no relation to our Lord, is worthy of no honor or worſhip, but may be burned or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without offence; &amp; as it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our Saviour, or as it is the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Chriſt of it ſelfe, it ſpeaketh of an inferiour thing to Chriſt our Lord, as the picture of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpeaketh of an inferiour thing to
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> and therefore cannot be worſhipped with the ſame honor which is due to Chriſt, but by accident or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and this is the opinion of all. Roman Catholiques.</p>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42187:133"/>civill pictures of well-deſerving men, which may redound to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory of God, by putting civil good thoughts into our minds.</p>

               <p>The ſecond kind is by images to repreſent to our ſight ſome viſible apparitions of God unto men, in ſuch ſhapes and formes as his will hath choſen, and not his nature fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as his walking in Paradiſe to ſeek <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the ſhape of

               <p>A third kind of ſetting forth God unto our minds by pictures and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is not to expreſſe his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate form, nature or eſſence by pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42187:134"/>or images, which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but by ſome remote and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſimilitude, which according to our weak capacity may put us in mind of him, or his attributes: As for example, to expreſs him as all-ſeeing by an eye, or as of in ſpeakable power, wiſdom goodneſs, by a <hi>Stork,</hi> which hath no tongue, for that no tongue is able to expreſſe his eſſence, nature, goodneſs, &amp;c. or els to ſhew that God is eternal, without beginning or end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by a circle which hath neither end nor beginning, &amp;c. as is more at large ſet downe by <hi>Pierius</hi> in his book of the ſacred Egyptian let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and this kind of painting or ſetting forth of God by pictures and images, hath alſo alwayes been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, otherwiſe thoſe who write, or print pictures and images for letters or characters, could have no Bible, or writ any thing of God, or of the myſteries of our faith, as the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Chinois;</hi> and this is called the

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As I have ſaid heretofore, the vertue of Religion hath divers acts or operations, whereof the chief is extended to God only, ſuch as is the profoundeſt humiliation and proſtration of the will, as to the firſt truth, firſt beginning, the chiefeſt good and laſt end of man, which for his excellency, is or may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led abſolute adoration, or a religious worſhip without addition, or a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, becauſe it hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or dependence upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this may not be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any creature: So when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay that a religious worſhip may not be given to the Angels and Saints &amp;c. they underſtand this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute religious worſhip, which is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42187:137"/>made with a whole proſtration or ſubmiſſion of the will, as to the chiefeſt good and laſt end of man, which were injuſtice to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any creature; and when they ſay that a religious worſhip may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to creatures, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth in the 21. cha. of his 20. book againſt <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> and others; they intend this relative or inferiour kind of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip, which we call for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſake relative, which may be beſtowed either upon the eminent creatures of God, according to the ſupernaturall excellency or dignity which he hath communicated unto them, or upon ſacred pictures, ſigns or images, for the relation they have unto the myſteries of our faith, or things in heaven; ſo as when we ſay God only is good, for that he is good of himſelf, infinite, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, it doth not hinder us to ſay that his creatures are good by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from his goodneſſe, no
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42187:137"/>more doth it hinder us to ſay, that his eminent creatures, upon whom he hath beſtowed grace and glory, or ſacred pictures, ſignes or images, which have a relation to the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our faith, or to the things of heaven, may be worſhipped with a relative religious worſhip, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God, and ſending us unto him, as unto our laſt end.</p>
               <p>According to this argument, you may prove that we ought not to uſe charity or love towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or towards any man, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and with thy whole ſoul, and thy whole mind, Deut.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Mat.</hi>
22.37. therefore may you ſay as you do of religious worſhip, you may not uſe charity or love unto any creature which is abſurd; but as the higheſt charity, and chiefeſt extenſion of our loves belongeth to God alone, as to our chiefeſt good, and an inferiour
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42187:138"/>kind of charity with relation unto him, may be uſed, and ought to be uſed towards his creatures; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the vertue of Religion, ſome acts are due unto God alone, others to be communicated to his eminent creatures; and if you can underſtand this of charity, you may eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſame of religious worſhip, or of any other vertue, how it may be uſed towards God alone, and how it may be communicated to his creatures depending upon him.</p>

                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Some of the more ſimple ſort of people amongſt you adore your pictures of God, or pray unto them, as unto a living thing.</p>

            <p>FOr concluſion, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that amongſt the many oppreſſions, which the enemy of mankind practiſeth over thoſe who by ſin he hath made his ſlaves, this is one, that he permitteth not unto any one of them the uſe of a pious thought, but if at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time a pious thought begin to appeare in any of their hearts or minds, he preſently ſnatcheth it away, as witneſſeth our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Matth. 13.19.</hi> thereby to force his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to begin their hell here upon earth: Wherefore if you permit no text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture publikely to paſſe amongſt the people, but ſuch as is corrupted by diſſenting tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, nor any Sermons to be heard, but ſuch as are made vain by differing opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in faith, nor ſacred pictures, ſignes, and images to be ſeen, which ſhall not be beaten down, as Idols, and their relative religious reſpect and reverence to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt as ſuperſtitious, as they are in this Iſland; what will be the iſſue? but that both pious thoughts and works baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every mans heart will be his hell, not only to the loſſe of their ſouls, but alſo in proceſſe of time to the destruction of our Nation, by vicious life, and wicked deeds.</p>
